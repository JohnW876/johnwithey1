## **Testing**
Throughout the project build, Chrome Developer Tools was used to inspect and test the website's responsiveness and functionality on mobile devices, tablets and desktop via a browser running from Gitpod. Any errors were then rectified through immediate modification of the code and further testing.

## **Responsiveness**

**Mobile:**

On mobile devices the navbar collapses to a navbar toggler or hamburger icon. Clicking this produces a dropdown menu which displays the navigation links to all pages on the website.
All images in the carousel, art galleries and About page display at close to full width of the screen in a single column.

**Tablets:**

On tablet devices the full navigation bar is shown with all nav links displayed across the top of the page.
The Galleries show images in 2 columns each taking up half the width of the screen.
The About page displays the profile image in the center of the screen and the content headings below span the full width of the screen. 

**Desktop:**

On desktop computers and laptops the full navigation bar is also shown. The carousel on the homepage is constrained to a maximum width of 800 px.
The image galleries display 4 columns of images across the width of the screen. 
The About page displays the profile image in the center of the screen and the content headings below span the full width of the screen. 

## **Device Testing**

### **Mobile**

* Apple iPhone XR using Safari on IOS 13.5.1
* Apple iPhone 7 using Safari on IOS 11.3.1
* Apple iPhone 8 using Safari on IOS 13.4
* Motorola Moto E5 using Google Chrome on Android 8.1

The website displayed well on all of the above browsers and devices. 
All interactive elements were tested and found to be working correctly except for the issues detailed below which have now been resolved.

### **Issues**
1. During development an issue with the iPhone 5/SE device showed whilst inspecting in Chrome DevTools where the navbar toggle dropdown was being pushed down and out of position by the logo at its’ usual size. 
2. On the image carousel two of the images appear to jump slightly as they fade from one image to the next.
3. On the Photography gallery page, two images appear slightly smaller than the others. 

### **Fixes**
1. Issue 1 - A media query was used to reduce the size of the logo when using devices up to a max of 320px wide, resolving the issue. 
2. Issue 2 - The images were resized and re-uploaded to match the other image sizes, this resolves the issue.
3. Issue 3 - The images were resized and re-uploaded to match the other image sizes, this resolves the issue.
