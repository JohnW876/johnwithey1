# **John Withey - Art Portfolio Website**


A portfolio website designed for an abstract artist and photographer. 
The main aim and purpose of the website is to showcase the artist’s work to specific user groups including art lovers, private and commercial art buyers, potential art agents and potential collaborators. 
This website is not intended to sell pieces of art to customers directly at this stage but it is designed to create interest which may enable the artist to market and sell to target users in future.

### Business needs of the website:
* To provide an access point to the work of the artist.
* To successfully show work by the artist in both art and photography to target user groups.
* To build an email list of interested users to be used in future marketing activity.
* To make the artist more accessible to users.
* To enable users to contact the artist easily.

### Needs of the user:
* View the artist’s work in an easily accessible way.
* Be able to easily find information on the artist and the services they offer.
* Be able to follow the artists progress over time.
* To keep up to date with news of the artist and their work.
* Be able to follow the artist on social media platforms.
* Be able to make contact with the artist to ask questions or to make enquiries.


## **UX**

The user types can be defined as one of the following:

* Art & Photography fans
* Private and commercial art/photography buyers
* Potential art/photo agents
* Fellow artists
* Potential collaborators.

These groups make up the target audience and each user has a reason or need to visit the site. The site has been designed to meet those needs as well as the needs of the artist.

Clear sections which relate specifically to all of the user types above are built into the website's design.

A mobile first approach was taken to create this project with consideration of ease of use and navigation to each of the features/sections. 


### **User Stories**

1. As a fan of art/photography, I want to discover work by new artists, so that I can satisfy my interests. 

2. As an artist’s agent, I want to quickly evaluate the suitability of a new artist, so I can decide whether or not to represent them. 

3. As an artist’s  agent, I want to follow the artist’s progress over time, so that I can assess their suitability for representation. 

4. As an artist/photographer, I want to see and view work by my piers, so I can find inspiration.

5. As a fellow artist/photographer, I want to find potential collaborators, so that I can get in touch and find out if we can work together.

6. As a fan of the artist, I want to get all the latest news, info and social activity, so I can keep up to date with my interests. 

7. As a commercial art buyer, I want to know if the artist undertakes commissions and be able to contact them, so I can easily commission a new piece of art work. 

8. As an art lover, I want to find unique art, so that I can buy work and support new artists. (This need will be addressed in features to implement in future)


### **Wireframe mockups:**
Below is a link to the project's wireframe mockups which were created using Balsamiq Wireframes software prior to the build to help with visualisation of features and layout. 

https://github.com/JohnW876/johnwithey1/tree/master/assets/wireframes

I found Balsmic very easy to use and it helped me to simplify my ideas and think about how to build in features that met the users needs before I started to write the code. 

Wireframe mockups were created for every page of the website at mobile, tablet and desktop sizes and I referred to them throughout the build. 
Because I had 15 mockups in total they were easier to compile into a pdf file that I referred to and could easily scroll through. 

Although I had some problems getting the wireframes to show up in Github early on, I eventually managed to get them to upload as individual png files to a wireframes folder within the assets folder. 

The only major change I made from my original wireframes was to make the gallery images on smaller devices be single columns and fill the screen width to follow the mobile first approach.  


## **Features**

The site includes a homepage featuring a carousel of images by the artist and a sign-up form to receive a newsletter.
There are separate image gallery pages for art and photography, an about page and a contact page.
There are main navigation links and social media links on every page. 

The website has been designed as minimalist to firstly allow the work to stand out and also to match the style of the artwork being displayed. It uses white space to a maximum and employs a minimal colour palette of blue and orange with only a few elements using a colour other than black or white. 
These colour elements include the logo at the top of each page, the form submit buttons (upon hover), the about page headings, social links and the contact form. 


### **Home**
In keeping with the minimalist design there are a few carefully chosen features on the homepage. 

* The logo which features on every page is important for immediate branding and its’ colour helps it to stand out. It lets the user know they are in the right place and tells them which artist’s website this is.
        It follows the convention of bringing the user back to the homepage when you click on it.

* The navigation bar clearly lets the user know about the different sections of the website and have been positioned in order of priority and in a natural flow from left to right. 
       This intended flow is to discover the artwork through the Homepage and Galleries, informing the user through the About section and then finally to encourage contact via the Contact page. 
       The clear headings also allow users to jump to their immediate area of interest if they wish. 

* From the homepage the user can get a first idea of the artist’s work by viewing the carousel and directly beneath there is a call out to encourage the user to sign up to the newsletter. 

* Below that in the footer are links to social media which change colour to orange when scrolled over to signify that they’re live, to encourage use and to create more impact. 

These features on the homepage are designed to fulfil the needs of users from the user stories above. 

### **Photography & Art Galleries**
Both the Photography and Art galleries are identical in featuring a thumbnail gallery of images. 
* They have been divided into categories to appeal to their appropriate user types with relevant user needs. So art lovers, fellow artists and art agents can easily find the art gallery and photography related users can easily find the photography gallery.
* Each gallery is separated into columns which responsively increase according to screen size. 
* On mobile devices they display as a single column wide, on tablets they increase to two columns wide and on desktop screens will display as four columns wide.

### **About**
Designed to provide information on both the artist’s background and current services offered to the relevant users. 
The page is simply divided into sections with large headings to make them clear and easy to find.
The content is clear, concise and the services content guides the user to get in touch via the contact page to meet both the user and business needs. 

### **Contact**
Featuring a simple contact form with message area to allow the user to make enquiries such as upcoming events, potential commissions, collaboration or agency representation. 
* Note the sign-up newsletter has been removed from this page to avoid dividing the users attention unnecessarily. 

### **Existing Features**

* Header Logo - Creates brand recognition and features at the top of every page of the website. Clicking the logo allows user to return to the homepage as expected. The colour helps it to stand out against the white background. 

* Header Navigation Bar - A simple navigation bar with links to every page allowing the user to jump to the sections they need. They are positioned in order of priority from left to right to guide the user through the site from discovering the work through to finding out about the artist and then to making contact.

* Image Carousel - Creates immediate impact and a focus on the artist’s work. This allows the user to get a feel for the work and decide if they want to see more via the navigation links.

* Callout - The call out directs the user to sign up to the newsletter. For users wanting to find out the latest news, events, offers etc this will be of interest and will meet their needs. It also serves the business objective of building a mailing list for future marketing. 

* Newsletter Sign-Up Form - Featured on every page except the contact form. For users it will give them lots of opportunities to sign up and receive the latest news, if that is their goal. It will also help to ensure the business objective of a mailing list is achieved. 

* Social Media Icons. Featured In the footer of every page with orange coloured hover. This powerful feature provides users quick and easy links to the artist’s social channels and benefits the user needs of all types as detailed in the user stories above. 

* Photography Image Gallery - On mobile devices, clicking on any image opens in a new window which removes all padding and presents on a plain black background. The user can see the work without distraction. On tablets and larger screens the effect is even more pronounced. The columns are responsive and will change according the screen size from single image column on mobiles to four columns on desktop. 

* Artwork Image Gallery - With identical features to the photography gallery but adding value to the user by dividing into a separate category to meet user needs. 

* About page - Allows the user to find out more about the artist and services being offered. Also contains links to social media in the footer if the user wishes to explore further and the content directs the user to get in touch if they have an enquiry. 

* Contact Form-  Allows the user to fill out a simple form with their contact details and a text area to add their message to the artist. 


### **Features to implement in future**

* E-Commerce functionality - If the website is successful in meeting its business objectives then a natural progression would be to offer e-commerce functionality to be able to sell original work and prints directly to the user. 
* Lightbox function in galleries - I would like to add more sophisticated functionality to the image galleries to add value and an improved user experience. Users could add their favourites to a Lightbox to view later and could tie in with purchasing if the e-commerce feature above was also implemented.
* Artist’s Blog - A blog would meet the needs of many target users and offer increased value through getting to know the artist and their ideas, inspirations, etc. 


## **Technologies Used**
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) Gitpod IDE was used to develop the website.
* The programming languages HTML & CSS are both used in this project.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework is used to make the website responsive on all devices. 
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/) is used to provide social media icons.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is used to provide styling to all type on the website. I opted for a single font of ‘Spartan’ to add to the minimalist theme. 
* [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) is used to create the favicon files and code in html page heads. 
* [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) were used prior to commencing coding to help with UX design, pre-visualisation and layout and were consulted throughout development.
* [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) were used to inspect the code and preview changes on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.


## **Testing**
Throughout the project build, Chrome Developer Tools was used to inspect and test the website's responsiveness and functionality on mobile devices, tablets and desktop via a browser running from Gitpod. Any errors were then rectified through immediate modification of the code and further testing.

### **Acknowledgements**
Inspiration for this project came from working as a professional photographer and artist for many years and always being frustrated at having to try and explain to web developers how I would like my website to be but not being able to contribute. 
I now appreciate their efforts much more as I understand the challenges a little better.

I'd like to thank my mentor Aaron Sinnott for helping with positive and constructive feedback during the project.
